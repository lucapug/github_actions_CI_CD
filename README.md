# github_actions_CI_CD

[DIY project of the week - DataTalksClub](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/project-of-the-week)

the goal is to experiment Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) techniques offered by the github actions tool.

Everything will be applied to the following problem:

A bank is investigating a very high rate of customer leaving the bank. In order to investigate and predict which of the customers are more likely to leave the bank soon (Exited column in the dataset), a dataset of 10.000 customers records is analyzed

Dataset source: [Deep Learning A-Z - ANN dataset | Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/filippoo/deep-learning-az-ann)

It's a binary classification problem over tabular data. The solution proposed as a starting point for the CI/CD experiments, is a Random Forest Classifier model, with target metric F1 score.
